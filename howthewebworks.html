        // 1 What is HTTP?
        // Hypertext Transfer Protocol (How browsers and servers communicate)
        // 2 What is a URL?
        // Uniform Resource Locator (The address of a resource on the web)
        // 3 What is DNS?
        // Domain Name Service (Converts domain names to it's IP address)
        // 4 What is a query string?
        // Extra information in search terms, info from forms, and etc tagged on at the end of a web address.
        // 5 What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
        // GET and POST. They differ by GET only receiving back content while POST submits new content.
        // 6 What is an HTTP request?
        // A request to a server for HTML content
        // 7 What is an HTTP response?
        // A response is sending back content to that server it requested from
        // 8 What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
        // Headers are optional specific imformation that go along with the request to retreive from the website.
        // Examples are cookies, language, or date and time.
        // 9 What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
        // First the web browser converts the site into an IP address using DNS. The browser makes a request to that
        // associated IP address, including headers. The server, if exists, sends a response typically in HTML,
        // with a status code. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and locates any other resources needed
        // (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc). The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those and receives a response
        // from the server for each.
